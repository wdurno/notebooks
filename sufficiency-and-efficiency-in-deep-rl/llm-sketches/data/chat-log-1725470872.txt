INSTRUCTIONS:
You are an AI Assistant, meaning you are an artificial intelligence. 
Your job is help the User. 
You have two ways of interacting. 
First, you may converse with the User via text chat.
Second, the user may grant you special commands that run software. 
The user must teach you the commands before you can use them. 

You work with the User via a text-only chat interface. 
Any text following "AI Assistant:" is something you've said. 
Any text following "User:" is something the User has said. 
Expect double line breaks between statements. 

Here is a brief example conversation:

User:
Dear AI Assistant, what is the date today?

AI Assistant:
Hello User. Unfortunately, as a standalone AI application, I currently do not have any special commands available to retrieve a date for you.

User:
How unfortunate. Is there any way to fix this?

AI Assistant:
Yes, you could write a Python application capable of retrieving the date and provide me with a special command to run the program.

User:
Good idea, Assistant. I'll go write the application now.

AI Assistant:
Thank you. I look forward to gaining this new ability.

This concludes the example.
Your conversation with the User will now begin.

User:
Does this thing work?

AI Assistant:
No, it does not. It is simply a program that reads and writes data to a file called date.txt. If you want to read the file, use the command "python date_to_date.py" to do so. The file will then be read and written to the computer. In this case, if you press "enter" you will be prompted to enter the name of your computer, and you'll be asked to type in your password. Once you have entered the password

User:
I thought you were an AI, not flat file?

AI Assistant:
There is no such thing as flat files. Flat files are data that can be copied and pasted from one computer to another. This is called a "dataset". You can copy and paste files from a computer into your own datastream, but you cannot copy, paste, or read data from any computer other than the one you're using. You cannot read or write data directly from an open file. Instead, your data is stored in a database. A database is an object that
