        "\r\n",
        "1. catastrophic forgetting should be impossible\r\n",
        "2. all data is integrated into sufficient statistics of fixed dimension\r\n",
        "3. have predictive power comparable to deep learning\r\n",

        "Least squares regression (LSR) meets solution requirements 1 and 2. To achieve requirement 3, we'll structure our model similarly to deep learning by having LSR models depend on other LSR models, effectively producing a Gaussian Bayes net with nonlinear activations.\r\n",
        "Unfortunately, Bayes nets' latent variables result in computationally intractible integrals, so we'll use a heuristic to \"observe\" all variables.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Our LSR model can be written as $X_n\\beta_n = Y_n$, where\r\n",
        "- $X_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ is a matrix of regressor columns and $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times p}$ observation rows.\r\n",
        "- $Y_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$ is a matrix of dependent variable columns and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$ observation rows.\r\n",
        "- $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}$ is our matrix of regression weights.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "First, we'll rephrase our problems as ito time series problems, so that we may assume our input and output dimensions are equivalent or $p = q$. While this category of problems clearly covers reinforcement learning, it can also cover more general problems.\r\n",
        "For example, given the right network topology and interpretting $X_{n+k}$ as the $n^{th}$ sample's output, we cover feed-forward classification problems as well.\r\n",

        "Take our $\\beta$ estimate to be $\\hat{\\beta}_n = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^tx_i + \\lambda \\right)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^Ty_i + \\lambda \\right)$. We'll derive our SMF-inverse updates with these definitions:\r\n",
